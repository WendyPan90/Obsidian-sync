## IPv4 Loopback Interfaces
* The loopback interface is a logical interface that is internal to the router.
* is considered a software interface that is automatically placed in an “up” state, as long as the router is functioning.
*  is useful in testing and managing a Cisco IOS device because it ensures that ==**at least one**== interface will always be available.
*  are also commonly used in lab environments to create additional interfaces.
* **Multiple** loopback interfaces can be enabled on a router.
* The IPv4 address for each loopback interface must be unique and unused by any other interface.
